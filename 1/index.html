                        When I was allocated the letter <b>U</b>, I will admit to being a bit stumped. I couldn't really
                        think of many words beginning with U - and certainly not many places.

                    <div class="text">
                        The first proper idea I had came during the lecture. During my found alphabet project I'd found
                        a new love for looking at architecture in different ways. I was especially enamoured with the
                        stained glass I'd come across in the John Rylands Library.

                    <div class="text">
                        I thought about the ways I could make this work on the page - perhaps a gold colour for the
                        frames, and then transparent or grey or blue for the panes? However I think this would be
                        difficult to square with the "two colours" requirement of the brief, as stained glass is usually
                        known for its huge range of colours depicting various scenes. Furthermore, I don't have any
                        particular personal connection to or link with stained glass; I'm not religious, I don't go to
                        church, there isn't really a good story behind my choice of letter.

                        In the lecture, I had a quick glimpse of the U produced for the Letterspace project. I thought
                        it looked very
                        interesting.

                                of my
                                favourites. It's definitely one of the most intriguing and interesting designs.

                                The story behind it is the ironwork on the fences of Whitworth Park, and the archway

                                shape of the U. Regrettably, this has had to be upside down in this letter for obvious
                                practical
                                reasons.

                                top. It reminds me of old architectural drawings and plans, which links to the theme
                                quite well.

                        In the studio session afterwards, we went through a few other letters and I drew out some ideas
                        I had for those. And whilst those are obviously not applicable for my <b>U</b>, they encouraged
                        me to think a bit less literally and to broaden my horizons.

                        I also drew out a few more <b>U</b>s. I thought about the basic constructions of the letter - a
                        circular bottom, extended in one direction by a rectangle. I thought of this idea, which looks a
                        bit like a venn diagram.

                                In the series Architectural Alphabet, he created imaginary palaces where the floorplans
                                made letters of
                                the alphabet. He then accompanied these with impressions of how a palace with such a
                                layout could look.
                                They are delightful in how they protray some of the eccentricities of the way we write
                                letters.

                                There is an element of humour to the drawings; buildings would not naturally take the

                                letterforms he has drawn, therefore some of the palaces he has drawn have their own
                                little quirks.

                                expected at that time. My favourite letterform has to be the N, which is such a
                                beautiful and
                                unconventional shape and yet makes an elegant palace.

                                is inherent in the design; encouraging the mixing of different sorts of fonts to create

                        also thought about just presenting a mirror as my final piece, and saying that it represents
                        "yo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">u</span>". I sketched out a few of these, seeing
                        where I could take them.

                                like an optical illusion, different ways of seeing the same threads as differing forms
                                depending on the

                                means that the font looks almost Blackletter in places, which is a very nice effect.

                        I then thought more about the letter <b>U</b>, and what it can refer to. I thought about the
                        phrase 'u-turn'; it's usually seen as a bad thing, an admission of failure. In politics, it's
                        the phrase used when a politician realises a policy is unpopular and backtracks. On a road, a
                        u-turn is recognising that the direction you were heading in was the wrong one.

                        This metaphor characterises such a movement as a negative one - I'm not sure I entirely agree.
                        There are two parts to every u-turn: the beginning, and the ending. But the ending is where it
                        remains afterwards, going off in the other direction. Accepting failure, yes. But turning round
                        and making it right again - that's more important, I believe.

                        lesson (I don't have much time for sport, either, to be honest). My teacher, terror in a blue

                        "Sit in silence", he said. "And copy this", pointing to one of Van Gogh's vase paintings he'd
                        put up on the overhead projector.

                        There were a few incidents where he ripped up the work of the pupils who'd made a mistake, and

                        the rest of the lesson being devoted to tidying and washing up. Twice, usually, at Mr Brown's

                        It was in the hours after school that I still "made stuff". On the computer mostly. I was lucky
                        that, from the age of about 5, my parents accepted that I wasn't going to spend hours playing
                        football with the other boys out on the street, and so they just left me on the computer,
                        messing about with Microsoft Office.

                        I never really considered there to be much of a link between all the stuff I did on the
                        computer, and "art" lessons at school. I'd not come across "graphic design" as a thing before,

                        A u-turn isn't necessarily negative. In fact, I think this experience proves that it can be an

                        But then I tried to think about ways to express the story underlying my piece - how to show the

                        There are two parts to every u-turn: the direction you were travelling initially, and the
                        direction you turn towards. For my project, it makes sense to express these as a sort of
                        classical/digital pairing, showing the transition I've been on with my attitude to art,
                        realising that making stuff on the computer is equally as valid an expression of creativity as
                        painting an old master.

                        I feel like the obvious way to express this is a transition between a painted stroke and a
                        crisp, clean line.

                        I made a decision that the terminus of the line should have an arrow - showing the continuation

                                It has made me appreciate that typography doesn't necessarily have to be in print or

                                It's out there in the world, somwehere where people can "reflect on their thoughts".

                        Some computer source code is added to the right hand side, an allusion to my fondness for
                        blending my passions of graphic design and computer programming. The code used is from the
                        Haversine formula, which I included in <a

                        I made.

                        included on Office XP, a reference to where my love of digital design began.

                        Some of the different ideas combined. This isn't my favourite of the designs; personally I think
                        it's trying to do too much at once. But this is the one I presented at the crit, as I feel it is
                        the one best suited to print.

                        I'm glad to have been able to make a range of ideas and explore a lot of the different thoughts
                        I had. I produced an animation of the different variations.

                        I printed the Composite variation and stuck it to the wall for the pin-up crit, alongside a
