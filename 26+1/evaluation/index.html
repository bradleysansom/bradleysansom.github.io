                        When I was told that I had to write an evaluation of this unit, I'll admit to being a bit
                        worried. I'd not really been enjoying the project that much, I thought my work wasn't really up
                        to standard and I'd not put enough effort into it. However, it's only in the process of writing
                        everything up into these pages, collecting together all the work I've done, that I've
                        reconsidered it.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        I've actually really liked it. I was a bit worried that, given I'm not a very good photographer,
                        or a very good illustrator, that I would struggle with the two briefs. And I did, for a while.
                        However, I've taken the briefs in a direction that I'm really proud of.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        With regard to research, the Type Player series of books has been a great help. I much prefer
                        looking through a curated selection of works, flicking from page to page, rather than endlessly
                        scrolling through Pinterest or Google Images. That's not to mean that I've not taken my research
                        in other directions; I've looked at quite a wide range of sources, illustrations, photography et
                        cetera. Quite a bit of the research was also personal; looking through an old hard drive to find
                        all the stuff I made in Microsoft Office as a young kid, I found that I've been (subconsciosuly)
                        designing things for years.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        When the brief for the second project put such an emphasis on having a story and a personal
                        connection, I panicked a bit. I always do with stuff like that, I just always suppose I've got
                        nothing especially revolutionary or groundbreaking to say. But realising the journey I've been
                        on for years with regard to my attitude to art, the 'u-turn', I've been able to explore my life,
                        and my mind, in quite a deep way through design.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        I happened upon my idea for the letterspace project quite quickly in comparison to others. I
                        remember being astounded at the first seminar when I had a couple of sketches and a little list,
                        and others had done a huge moodboard and had 50 ideas. But I shouldn't have worried, as the
                        development came a bit later but got quite deep and personal.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        My final pieces don't follow the briefs to the letter; I had an urge to make MORE. Therefore
                        I've done two interactive posters rather than just the one, and I've done eight variations of
                        the letter. Perhaps I ought to learn to sift this down a bit, be a bit more critical of my
                        ideas.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        For the found alphabet project, I'm reasonably happy with my final outcomes. If I was doing it
                        again or had more time, I'd make the interactive digital version a bit nicer. Currently it's
                        very stark and simple, I could use the opportunity of a digital space to play about with motion
                        and animation a bit more.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        For the letterspace project, I wanted to produce something a bit more animated too. Perhaps a
                        video version, showing the u-turn in a more dynamic way. I also had an idea to make a triptych
                        of the U at different stages of its completion, but decided just to concentrate on the one
                        layout for the final piece.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        If I was doing the found alphabet project again, I think I would've walked around with a list of
                        letters that I could cross off. I spent a lot of time taking duplicate pictures whilst not
                        getting some for others until quite late.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        If I was doing the letterspace project again, I would refine the figure itself. I think I
                        should've used more of a regular, curved U instead of the freehand right half that I just made
                        with the pen tool.

                        Despite these few regrets, on the whole, I'm pleased with the work I've done in this unit. I've
                        really enjoyed it.
