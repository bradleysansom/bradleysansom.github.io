                <h4 class="subtitle">Discover educational activities that will ignite historical exploration of the
                    Bradford Colliery</h5>
                    <p>The Bradford Pit Project aims to revive the memory of the colliery and educate and engage a new
                        audience about its
                        history and its legacy, much of which is still relevant today. Why? We understand that it is
                        important to acknowledge
                        the heritage that the site offers and understand its significance as it has consequently
                        impacted
                        the development and
                        the lives of those in the area. This Schools and Educational Activities page can therefore be
                        used
                        as a tool to achieve
                        our objective whilst also sharing information about the colliery in a fun and engaging way.
                        We have also had great success in our previous in-person activities which you can see below,
                        involving people of all
                        ages, cultures and backgrounds welcoming public input in order to integrate communities through
                        heritage.

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Guidance for teachers</h4>
                    <p>In this space you will find a range of activities you can use as a class, in small groups or as
                        individuals to enable
                        students to learn about the project, the colliery, and the stories we have highlighted. We
                        suggest
                        allowing time for
                        your students to explore this page where they will find unique, interactive, and engaging
                        material
                        that will stimulate
                        their comprehensive skills along with their creativity and imagination. Whilst some of the
                        material
                        is targeted towards
                        Secondary school students, there is a range of activities for all levels so that all students
                        will
                        be able to learn,
                        understand, and have fun whilst exploring history. To help, we have recommended the appropriate
                        age
                        range for each
                        activity so you as the teacher can guide your students as they learn.</p>
                    <h4 class="subtitle">Guidance for students</h4>
                    <p>This webpage is full of creative activities that will introduce you to the history of the
                        Bradford
                        coal mine. The
                        activities below will help you to learn about the proud past of the site, its people and its
                        surroundings and will also
                        allow you to use your imagination as you begin important discussions about the site. We have
                        pulled
                        together a range of
                        activities for you to do including worksheets and creative writing, and have highlighted our
                        Audio
                        Library so you can
                        listen to some of the miners' real stories - so get exploring!</p>

                <p>These worksheets are available to download as a pdf and are printable.
                    We suggest verbally sharing information with your students as they fill these sheets in – sharing
                    digestible information
                    about what the project is, why the project was started, and what the colliery was. This information
                    is available on our
                    About page.

                <h4 class="subtitle">Print work</h4>
                <p>This activity will give students the ability to create their own material commemorating the colliery
                    and the miners.
                    Using materials like charcoal, paint and fabric, see our featured story from 31 March 2015 where
                    ex-miner Brian Grayson
                    preserved the Bradford branch's National Union of Miners banner and create your own banner design!
                    This activity can be done whilst verbally sharing digestible information about what our project is,
                    why the project was
                    started, and what the colliery was - all available on our About page.
                    This activity is recommended for lower Primary school students and above.

                <h4 class="subtitle">Explore our interactive map</h4>
                <p>Able to explore our fully interactive map as a class, small group or individually, students will gain
                    a great
                    understanding of just how big the colliery was. There are also many stories to explore, and plenty
                    of opportunities to
                    begin interesting discussions.
                    This activity is recommended for mid-high Primary school students and above.

                <p>Our Audio Library features real-life stories told by those who worked at the pit along with
                    recordings from other people
                    such as the miners' wives. We have also animated a few of these stories!

                <h4 class="subtitle">Try your hand at creative writing</h4>
                <p>Use the activities on this webpage as a tool to help you understand the lives of people affected by
                    the colliery. Use
                    this to help create a short story pretending you are a minor, a miner's family member, or whoever
                    else you can think of.
                    Perhaps you could even create a storyboard to tell your story where you can draw images to bring
                    your imagination to
                    life!</p>
                <h4 class="subtitle">Use our audio library to discuss important topics</h4>
                <p>Our collection of oral histories gives great information shared by people with first-hand experience
                    of the pit and told
                    in their voices. Use this collection to discuss what the impact the colliery's closure in 1968 had
                    on a) the community
                    b) families c) minors themselves, and d) occupational choice. Think about the camaraderie and
                    relationships developed
                    inside and outside the mine!
                    This activity is recommended for Secondary school students and above.

                <h4 class="subtitle">Explore the stories available on our website to discuss the pit's attraction</h4>
                <p>Using our interactive map, focus on the Cemetery and acknowledge the amount of people associated with
                    the pit and read
                    the stories we have highlighted. Also explore our Accidents and Incidents page. Use these stories to
                    help you discuss as
                    a class, in small groups or individually why you think that despite the Pitt being a dangerous and
                    unpredictable
                    environment, why so many people chose to work there?
                    This activity is recommended for Secondary school students and above.
