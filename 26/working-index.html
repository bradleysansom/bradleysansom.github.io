                        The first few photographs were taken inside and just outside Benzie building. My eye was
                        immediately
                        caught by the metal framework of the staircases and bridges, within which numerous letterforms
                        could
                        be made out.

                        definitely wanted to take lots of photos of parts of buildings where letterforms could be found.

                        Walking up Oxford Road, I began to notice letter shapes in a variety of places, especially in
                        street furniture, looking at it in a way I never had done before. I experimented with the
                        negative space of the blank sky around a lamppost, perhaps forming a <b>G</b>.

                        which formed a <b>c</b>. I also photographed some of the road markings, where the double yellow
                        lines formed various letterforms in positive and negative space.

                        The backstreets behind Piccadilly were home to bits of detritus, and less modern, clean

                        I found that the more modern buildings around the Arndale are less interesting to photograph and
                        contain far fewer details which resemble letterforms. One exception was the curious spire over
                        the National Football Museum, and the anti-skateboarding spikes on the benches in front, which I
                        thought had an interesting shape. I also found what I believe was half the base of a traffic
                        cone, which looked a bit like a <b>D</b>.

                        checking the weather forecast. A momentary hailstorm welcomed me to Moston, and the time spent
                        sheltering under trees in a park made me find this <b>H</b>-shaped bench, along with some

                        Just as I was about to leave the park, I saw a path weaving off to the right and down an old
                        staircase. I was intrigued, so followed it, to find it went down to a rickety boardwalk beside
                        the Moston Brook. The meanders were the obvious opportunity to try and find the shape of a
                        letter <b>s</b>, which I spent quite some time doing. There were some areas where trees had
                        fallen down over the path, out of which I tried to find some more letterforms.

                        I left the park at the other end, on to a road bordering a cemetery, which was home to this
                        charming structure. The influences that Roman and Venetian architecture had on this (Catholic)
                        burial ground are clear to see. I saw various shapes, but the roofline and arch beneath are
                        particularly clear letterforms.

                        I carried on walking up the hill where I found a park around a lake. The supports for the
                        benches have the shape of a <b>Y</b> or perhaps a <b>T</b>, depending on interpretation.

                        By this time, the rain had stopped and the sun was coming out. A double rainbow appeared; I
                        spent quite a while working out how to take a photo which could be used in this project. I
                        walked to another park, where the evening sun meant my body cast a long shadow on the grass,
                        forming an <b>A</b>. I also took a picture of a bench which had some similarity with a lowercase
                        <b>t</b>.

                        I wasn't able to find any for some letters, and found duplicates for others, for which cases I
                        produced animated GIFs which cycle through the candidates.

                        It's become clear that there are two predominant themes in the photographs I've taken: nature,
                        such
                        as parts of trees and foliage; and architecture, where the letters are formed by parts of
                        buildings.
                        Having
                        discussed this with my tutor group, it may be a good idea for me to develop two alphabets, one
                        for
                        each theme. There is a clear thematic contrast - the 'real' with the 'fake', if you will -
                        between
                        the materials exhibited in the two sets,
                        which could be a good thing to show in the alphabets.

                        I am probably most drawn to the colours of the architectural selection; the oranges, browns, the
                        copper colours. My favourite is the image of the hook on the tiles, which are such a lovely
                        shade.

                        After examining the depth of the two groups when seperated, it becomes obvious that I will need

                        take more
                        photographs if I'm to develop two complete alphabets.
