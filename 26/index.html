                        The first few photographs were taken inside and just outside Benzie building. My eye was
                        immediately
                        caught by the metal framework of the staircases and bridges, within which numerous letterforms
                        could
                        be made out.

                        quickly caught my eye, forming the shape of a lowercase <b>m</b>. I knew from then that I
                        definitely wanted to take lots of photos of parts of buildings where letterforms could be found.

                        Walking up Oxford Road, I began to notice letter shapes in a variety of places, especially in
                        street furniture, looking at it in a way I never had done before. I experimented with the
                        negative space of the blank sky around a lamppost, perhaps forming a <b>G</b>.

                        which formed a <b>c</b>. I also photographed some of the road markings, where the double yellow
                        lines formed various letterforms in positive and negative space.

                        The backstreets behind Piccadilly were home to bits of detritus, and less modern, clean
                        buildings, which made for more interesting photographs and letterforms.

                        I found that the more modern buildings around the Arndale are less interesting to photograph and
                        contain far fewer details which resemble letterforms. One exception was the curious spire over
                        the National Football Museum, and the anti-skateboarding spikes on the benches in front, which I
                        thought had an interesting shape. I also found what I believe was half the base of a traffic
                        cone, which looked a bit like a <b>D</b>.

                                I really like the use of parts of buildings, especially the staircases. It reminds me of

                                architectural movement, where the services, such as pipes and lift shafts, go on the

                                building, most famously at the Pompidou Centre in Paris or the Lloyds building in

                                Simashev's typeface. Each letter is made up of a few common elements, but there's enough

                                Elliman's habit of collecting started back when he was young and living in Liverpool;
                                his journey as a
                                designer has been informed by the places he's lived and travelled, picking up detritus
                                along the way to
                                make letterforms out of.

                                His work really appeals to me. I really like the utilitarianism of it all; taking
                                objects which are
                                designed a particular way because of their function, and using their unique shapes to
                                represent letters.
                                He plays about with scale, combining items of differing sizes into a consistent
                                alphabet.

                                The strength of Found Font, to me, is in the self-contained nature of each item. He
                                picks things up and
                                then makes them into individual letters. They're not a part of a whole, they are a
                                complete letterform
                                in one object, on a white background. This means that the whole font is incredibly
                                adaptable; when the
                                items have their colours taken away and are simply given a black fill, an incredibly
                                usable and unique
                                typeface is born.

                        In a show of poor planning on my part, I boarded a tram destined for suburbia without first
                        checking the weather forecast. A momentary hailstorm welcomed me to Moston, and the time spent
                        sheltering under trees in a park made me find this <b>H</b>-shaped bench, along with some
                        letters made out of bits of trees and the environment.

                        the Moston Brook. The meanders were the obvious opportunity to try and find the shape of a
                        letter <b>s</b>, which I spent quite some time doing. There were some areas where trees had
                        fallen down over the path, out of which I tried to find some more letterforms.

                        burial ground are clear to see. I saw various shapes, but the roofline and arch beneath are
                        particularly clear letterforms.

                        themes: architecture and nature. I think it'd be a waste to try and stick to just one and scrap
                        the others at this stage; the photos I'm going to take will encompass both themes. Perhaps I
                        will make two alphabets.

                                The colour scheme is lovely, and reflects the colours of the architecture in the town.

                                One of my favourite letterforms is the S, made from the spiral staircase. I also like
                                the E in the
                                negative space of the bricks.

                                My one criticism is that some of the letters aren't as legible when read in isolation.
                                Having A to Z on
                                the poster means that it is intuitive to understand which letter the next photograph is
                                going to be,
                                even if it would otherwise be difficult to recognise. This is something I'd like to
                                avoid on my

                        Rather suprisingly for the famously dry city of Manchester, it was raining again. Heavily,
                        in fact. I hopped on a tram and hoped it would clear by the time we got to the terminus at
                        Eccles.
                        Unfortunately it didn't, but I persisted anyway in attempting to find more stuff to photograph.

                        may appear, a river. However, the ripples of the rainwater did make some lovely shapes, which
                        from a few angles look a bit like letters.

                                an angle... But all of them are presented in such a way that the letters of the final

                                be greyscale has paid off. It avoids the page being too colourful and detracting from
                                the main focus,
                                the shapes of the letters found in architecture around her.

                        electrical box, which
                        make a fab <b>B</b><br>• The roof of the back bit of the Trafford Centre, which could be an

                        idea during the lecture itself, which I sketched up quickly on the back of the sheet.

                        info about each letterform.

                        I have taken the letters I've got so far and assembled them into a simple grid

                        produced animated GIFs which cycle through the candidates.

                        It's become clear that there are two predominant themes in the photographs I've taken: nature,
                        such
                        as parts of trees and foliage; and architecture, where the letters are formed by parts of
                        buildings.
                        Having
                        discussed this with my tutor group, it may be a good idea for me to develop two alphabets, one
                        for
                        each theme. There is a clear thematic contrast - the 'real' with the 'fake', if you will -
                        between
                        the materials exhibited in the two sets,
                        which could be a good thing to show in the alphabets.

                        I found some drainpipes up the back of Strangeways that made a nice little arrangement, perhaps
                        a <b>y</b>.

                        Back down in the city centre, I took a final few shots of some architectural details including
                        the arches of the Town Hall Extension, and some ironwork down by the canal.

                                Bruno Munari was an Italian artist who designed a wide range of works informed by
                                emotions. Koroknai
                                chose to pay tribute to him by creating a type experiment around one of his famous
                                quotations.

                                features; encouraging artists to use nature more in their work.

                                The cross-sections of the trees that she has used are beautiful in themselves; they are

                                shaped and imperfect - like a lot of things in nature. This contrasts well with the

                                stark sans-serif typeface used on the wording and imprinted into the wood - but this is

                                by the cracks and holes in the tree. This is a fitting metaphor for the quote that
                                Koroknai is

                        The next day, I wanted to go out and take photos of more natural objects with letterforms in
                        them. Rather than walking round the city centre and the suburbs trying to find bits of greenery
                        here and there, I decided to go on the tram down to Wythenshawe Park, a huge green space with
                        woods and vast open spaces, where I was sure to find enough things to photograph. I played about
                        with the Macro function on my phone's camera, taking close ups of bits of foliage, allowing me
                        to get smaller details into my images.

                                Sandved's <i>Butterfly alphabet</i> took him 24 years to create. He was a nature
                                photographer, who had a particular interest in the intricate patterns on the wings of
                                butterflies.

                                I just love the beautiful colours of the letters. I also admire the fact that every
                                letterform is extremely clear; it's obvious that he spent a great amount of time getting
                                his
                                alphabet to perfection.

                                Whilst I've nowhere near as much time to be spending on this project, that spirit of
                                perfectionism is definitely something I've felt during this project. I've counted the

                                I've taken during this project - well over 750, many of which are of the same thing,
                                multiple shots, trying different angles to see what's most clear and what will look the
                                most
                                recognisable as both a letter and a found object.

                                I really like the theme being so narrow - Sandved set himself a challenge, and the

                                is all the better for it. I definitely think that my decision to go with two themes will
                                pay
                                off, making two distinct alphabets rather than trying to combine them into one
