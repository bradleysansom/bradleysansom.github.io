                        being stuck as part of the background of an article. Sometimes it acts as a headline, sometimes
                        it's a word related to the article, and occasionally it's a logo or symbol relevant to the
                        article.</div>
                    <div class="text">It's quite clever really, as there's a lot of potential in the directions you can
                        go with the idea. Each article has its own colour scheme, allowing individual personalities to
                        shine through, whilst at the same time keeping visual continuity through the magazine.

                        minimalist.</div>

                    <div class="text">Some great art direction has gone on here; the magazine has run an event and taken
                        photographs with a clear look ahead to how they'd be presented in the magazine. People were
                        pictured against a blue and pink background, the colours of which are used in the backgrounds of
                        the other pages to form a really cohesive standalone section of the magazine.</div>
                    <div class="text">The designer has played about with columns in an unconventional way, setting type
                        right up to the edge of white boxes. I'm not totally sure it works, but the idea's interesting.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">The two colours they've used seem quite reminiscent of those you'd see in the
                        'boys' and 'girls' sections of a baby clothes shop - I don't know whether this was some sort of
                        attempt to make a point about gender equality in the tech industry perhaps? Nevertheless, I
                        think they work really well, and they're striking within the context of a tech magazine.

                        This spread is the first of a section about cakes, which has a circular theme. The magazine is
                        otherwise quite conventional and boxy, whereas this is a highlight. I like that it uses both
                        sides of the spread. The theme of the page is carried over directly from the huge image.

                        repeated in different colour combinations, to give individuality to each section and topic
                        whilst retaining visual continuity.</div>
                    <div class="text">The pattern itself is really nice, echoing embroidery patterns, which reflects the

                        a sort of vintage typewriter style, that I'm not sure quite fits with the rest of the page. It's
                        a style that's a bit overdone perhaps, although I believe this magazine is a few years old now.

                        <div class="text">It's a brilliantly playful idea for a spread, all about pin badges. The theme
                            is incorporated really well into the layout including the headline, which is given a gold
                            outline and a shadow to make it look like a badge itself. I like how the badge images are
                            scattered all over the page, in much the same way that they'd get attached to a garment.
                            Furthermore, the body copy is placed at jaunty angles to fit with this theme. The effect is
                            really well done, it's not too distracting and doesn't hamper readability.</div>
                        <div class="text">My one suggestion would be to change some of the badge images so there aren't
                            as many duplicates.</div>
                        <div class="text">The presentation of the article is really well-suited to the subject matter
                            and tone of voice of the writing. Brilliant effort.

                    When looking through magazines, I logged on to the website Pressreader, which is free to holders of
                    a Manchester library card. I saw dozens of magazines on there, a lot of which are of the
                    mass-market, 'pile as much in as possible' style. Not inherently bad, of course, it's just that a
                    lot of them can look poorly designed.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    I found this to be a pleasant exception. It has a great structure but it isn't too rigid or formal.
                    A lot of the layout is made out of photographs, which I think look great.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Also I really like the colours. I just wish there was a bit more personality in the headline, rather
                    than having to conform to the house style and using the same font as every other article in the
                    magazine.

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="text">I also did research into a couple of other magazines, which were impractical to scan due to
            their size.</div>
        <div class="gallery"><img src="ice and emergency.png" alt=""></div>
        <div class="text">I thought these were well-designed, but not especially nice to read. Huge newspaper style
            things they were, I think twice the size of a broadsheet. I liked the bits where the structure had been
            played with a bit, with text set at jaunty angles and headlines overlapping it all, but I'll admit it makes
            it a little bit harder to read. However I appreciate that there is an important stylistic and contextual
            reasoning behing the interventions into the structure; as a metaphor for climate breakdown, I think it works
            well.</div>

            <div class="text">I was impressed by Anderson's attention to detail, in particular the symmetry in a lot of
                the scenes.</div>
            <div class="text">The scenes that most appealed to me were those with an architectural theme, especially one
                in the third act with the car chase. It switched between filmed sequences and a cartoon style. I can't
                find a screengrab of the particular scene I'm referring to, but this is how it was rendered in the
                cartoon version:</div>

                of Wes's films on to my spreads. At first I considered adopting some of the bright colours that the
                scenes had in places. But then my second idea occured when the scene with the arches came on. I knew I
                wanted to replicate it with my designs.</div>

                        However, I noticed by a blogpost on Pentagram's website that they've recently redesigned the
                        magazine. Each section now uses a different colour of paper. I think this is a great idea - the
                        white background before is perhaps a result of budget constraints as much as anything, so
                        anything that can add colour in an unconventional way is interesting to me.

            <div class="title b">Some ideas</div>
            <div class="text">My next steps were to translate this idea into something that could be a magazine spread.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="sketches/arches-impact-1.png" alt=""><br><img
                    src="sketches/arches-info-1.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I drew out an iteration of my idea on graph paper. I wanted to use arches almost as
                windows, with the page background being a wall to look through as opposed to be a board to stick things
                on, if you get what I'm saying.</div>
            <div class="text">This version would involve a big image on the impact spread, cropped to fit behind the
                three arched windows. I had a few concerns with this layout, however:
                <ul>
                    <li>The title would be spread across the gutter, which (although being symmetrical) wouldn't be
                        ideal.</li>
                    <li>I wasn't sure that any of the assets would lend themselves to being split across three windows
                        of a double page spread like that, especially if I wanted to keep the symmetry going.</li>
                    <li>Having different widths of arched windows would mean having different radii of arches - this is
                        perhaps more clearly a problem on gridded paper than in reality, but still it wouldn't
                        necessarily look right, or especially Wes Anderson-y. </li>
                </ul>
                I put numbers on to the information spread for each of the mini articles, because I thought without them
                it would look quite bare. But I don't really think the way they've been placed here looks very good
                either.
            </div>
            <div class="text">So I carried on, drawing out different versions of the arch idea.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="sketches/arches-impact-2.png" alt=""><img src="sketches/arches-info-2.png"
                    alt=""><br><span class="caption">I would just like to take this time to apologise to Mr Anderson for
                    being so terrible at
                    drawing faces that none of my depictions look anything like him. And the most unflattering is yet to
                    come...</span></div>
            <div class="text">Thinking that having so many arches could look a bit overbearing, I instead thought back
                to that scene from The French Dispatch, where the arched were at either side and all the action was
                happening in the middle. That led me to this idea, of arched image frames being cropped to the extreme
                left and right of the spread, with the main imagery and copy in the centre.</div>
            <div class="text">Again, I had reservations about having copy running across the gutter. But I thought that
                this was perhaps less of a problem on this spread, because the type was left aligned to the only letters
                spanning the gutter would be in 'accidental' and not in either of the shorter words.</div>
            <div class="text">The information spread focussed more on using the arches less as a window and more as a
                doorway, going right to the floor, holding content within them. This was a better idea, I thought,
                because there's more flexibility as to what can go in the columns.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="sketches/arches-impact-3.png" alt=""><img src="sketches/arches-info-3.png"
                    alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Curved type was definitely something I knew I wanted to explore, as a nod to the sign of
                the hotel in The Grand Budapest Hotel. </div>
            <div class="text">I explored a few different ways of getting the arches in, whether as frames for columns or
                as content themselves. </div>
            <div class="text">I want to incorporate symmetry, yes. But there are idiosyncracies to Anderson's direction
                as well; some witty positioning so that things aren't exactly right and instead have a tad of visual
                interest. In the information spread above, I played about with the positioning of text and images within
                the arched frames. Something to think about anyway.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="sketches/arches-impact-4.png" alt=""><img src="sketches/arches-info-4.png"
                    alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">What I wanted to achieve with this iteration was to maintain the arches and symmetry
                whilst clearing up a few of the problems re the gutter.</div>
            <div class="text">I tried something different with the information spread, consigning the arch design to
                just one in the middle, holding a collage of images. Not so sure.</div>
            <div class="text"><br>The thing about all these arch designs... I've put them into pairs of spreads based on
                when I drew them. But really, any of the impact spreads can go with any of the information spreads, like
                so:

            <div class="text">It's looking likely I'll go with this idea, but I could go for any of the combinations.
            </div>
            <div class="title a">A different idea</div>
            <div class="text">I did have another idea for my layouts, however.</div>
            <div class="text">When I saw the Grand Budapest Hotel key box poster in the assets folder, I thought it'd
                make a nice spread if I manipulated it.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="sketches/keys-impact.png" alt=""><img src="sketches/keys-info.png"
                    alt=""><br><span class="caption">I wasn't lying when I said I can't draw faces. Sorry Wes.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="text">The idea is to use the key boxes and the tags within them as frames for text and images.
                I'd use a grid of two rows and five columns on the information spread, and one box on each page on the
                impact spread.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="hotel-mockup.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I made a rough mockup of what this would look like.</div>
            <div class="text">(in Powerpoint):</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="hotel.gif" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I was happy with it. Only 'happy' though. Not ecstatic or anything. I thought it's a bit
                unoriginal perhaps. Takes far too much from one asset and not much of my own design. I spoke to Hitch,
                who echoed my thoughts about it being an alright idea, but nothing revolutionary. So I think I'll forget
                that idea, and focus on the arches.</div>
            <div class="title a">Getting over my fear of InDesign</div>
            <div class="text">John and Fern did a very useful lecture introducing InDesign, which I found helpful. I
                played about with grids:</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="grid.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">...colour schemes and photographs...</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="pink.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">...before starting to create something with an arched design.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="arch-first.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">You'll notice that I've tried to put a square grid in on the above spread. Unfortunately,
                that's not mathematically possible, such is the aspect ratio of a piece of A4. Therefore the radii of my
                arches are one column wide, but that's slightly more than one row high. It was at this point that I felt
                the urge to bang my head on the desk. But still, it doesn't really matter I suppose. Although I like
                everything to be all mathematical and perfect, a lot of the charm of Anderson's work is the bits that
                aren't perfect or polished.</div>
            <div class="text">After the session, I didn't want to immediately make the decision of what spreads to make.
            </div>
            <div class="text">I had a play about in InDesign with text and images, seeing how they fit in arches.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="arches.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">So, in short, the things I learned: justified text looks nice but can end up unsightly and
                with rivers all over the place, left align is more readable but you lose the arch effect, images in
                arches generally look alright, unless they're a picture that's meant to be landscape, and try to avoid
                putting book covers in an arch as it doesn't look like a book then.</div>
            <div class="text">I had another go with arches in a grid. This time, ones of different radii.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="arches.gif" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'm not so sure about mixing differently-sized arches on the page like that (especially
                when the grid's shown). It looks from afar like a domed building with towers either side, rather than a
                wall with two archways in it. I don't think I'll mix arches like this on my final spreads.</div>
            <div class="text">Anyway, I decided it was time I bit the bullet and started to digitize some of my designs.
            </div>
            <div class="title b">Actually making a start</div>
            <div class="text">I decided to start with the impact spread with the big type and the cut-out portrait of
                Wes.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="wes-1.gif" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'm not so sure about the text overlapping the image. Looks a bit busy. I really like the
                colours though. And I think the balance is alright, considering it could've been very lopsided.</div>
            <div class="text">The image I used for the background... it's not exactly cheating, I hope. Basically I took
                a bit of the background from the asset from The Royal Tenenbaums, shifted the hue a bit to be more
                yellowish, and suddenly it looks a bit like ivory. It's a bit nicer than just sticking a block colour
                there.</div>
            <div class="text">I reckoned when I sketched out this one that it'd look nice but be an unusable spread. As
                I expected, finding an image to fit in the two narrow slivers of archway is difficult. Also I found
                cutting out the picture of Wes Anderson unusually difficult. It's quite a low res image. I think a lot
                of the assets seem to be.</div>
            <div class="title a">Making a wordmark</div>
            <div class="text">Not quite sure which design I wanted to go with, but sure it'll be one involving arches. I
                want to have a bit of an exploration of arched typography, in particular as a headline to the article.

            <div class="text">So I've now got the basic bits of a wordmark. I'm not quite sure why I picked that
                typeface, Bungee (from Google Fonts), but I knew that I wanted to use it (having forgotten what it was
                called but knowing that Google had a font that was chunky and rounded and angular and had lines running
                through it).</div>
            <div class="text">I played about with the position of 'THE LIFE'.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="caps/spaced.png" alt=""><br><img src="caps/stacked.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'm not sure. I'm chronically indecisive, as you can tell.</div>
            <div class="text">I've done the same with a few different fonts.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="fonts.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'm not quite consciously sure what was the decision behind choosing the typefaces I did.
                I was obviously inspired by the logos for The French Dispatch and The Grand Budapest Hotel. But I'd not
                looked that closely, and chose four fonts which don't exactly resemble them directly. I think the third
                option is the best, in terms of being the simplest, most legible font, and perhaps the most
                sophisticated. The other three... the first is maybe too childish, the second is too textured, and the
                fourth looks more at home saying 'saloon' in a low-budget fairground.</div>
            <div class="text">So option 3 it is. The font is called Bonzer San Francisco, from Dafont.</div>
            <div class="text">I drew a simple frame behind the text to see how it'd look, trying to replicate the sort
                of sign above the hotel.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="frame.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">The one thing I'm not dead keen on is the curve. I think it might be better with a smaller
                radius.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="caps/curvy.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I think that's better. Next I tried to add THE LIFE to that, using a second curve above.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="caps/double.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Not so sure. Might have to stick to using properly nested circles if I'm going with
                something like this.</div>
            <div class="text">I decided to go with the three-level stack idea for the headline wordmark. </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="tier.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I quite like that. Might have to play about with the colour of the frame so it's less
                obvious.</div>
            <div class="title b">Meanwhile</div>
            <div class="text">I was trying out a few iterations of layouts with the wordmarks I'd designed. </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="accidental.png" alt=""><br><img src="brown.png" alt=""><br><img src="red.png"
                    alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">A lot of these weren't really working, balance-wise. That cemented my decision to use a
                wordmark on a more curved frame.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="layercake.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'd say that's more like it. Needs something else though.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="not it.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Not that. I tried using a bit of sky from one of the images. Too low res to look
                good I think.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="gold.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">That might be too far in the other direction though. A bit sparse.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="simpler.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I like the direction I'm going in. The colours are alright. I've decided to extend both
                the frame and the portrait down to meet the floor.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="goldenarches.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I stuck another arch in to frame the copy, and moved the headline frame downwards
                slightly. I think it looks more balanced that way.</div>
            <div class="title a">Final impact spread design</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="wes-impact-mockup.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'm happy with that.</div>
            <div class="title b">Making the impact spread</div>
            <div class="text">So I'm not quite sure which of the sketched designs I'm going to do for the information
                spread. But I need to try and maintain some sort of visual continuity with the impact spread.</div>
            <div class="text">Therefore I'm going to make a set of subheadings in the style of the headline, using
                arched text.</div>
            <div class="text">My first attempt involved using the same curve twice, making two rows of type on a path.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="duplicate.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Using the same curve twice looks alright here, where the lines are short and so the gap
                between the two rows is consistent. But that isn't true where the lines are longer, which results in the
                text bunching together.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="nasty.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I made these for all six of the articles to see what it'd be like.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="specimen.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">It was clear that I had to go back and redrew them, using proper nested curves this time.
            </div>
            <div class="text">At this time I had to decide which of the mini-articles I'd go for. I made the decision
                based on the four that I could condense the titles of down to two short lines: probably not a decision
                I'd realistically be able to make myself.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="nested.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">That's better.</div>
            <div class="title a">Producing an impact spread</div>
            <div class="text">I decided to go with the second sketch I did for the information spreads.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="sketches/arches-impact-2.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">This gives me enough flexibility whilst working with a similar style to the impact spread
                - using the arch design as a proper archway rather than a window.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="explor.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">This was my first design. It definitely feels like the sort of thing I want to go for.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="white.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I think it works better with a background. Makes it a tad more readable and maintains some
                visual continuity with the impact spread. It's perhaps a bit less 'designed', and looks a bit more 'mass
                market' maybe. But I think I prefer it.</div>
            <div class="text">I broke one of the rules I set out earlier here, by cropping the book cover into an arch
                shape. Given the article's prefaced by 'with the release of this book' and ends in 'buy the book here',
                it seems clear that the book cover image should be shown in all its rectilinear glory.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="rectified.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I've rectified this in the above spread, by making the images take the full width of the
                arched columns. Not sure myself.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="boxless.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">This is essentially the version of the above but with the images all squared off. I don't
                like the top bits though. Feels like I'm abandoning my arch idea too much.</div>
            <div class="text">I don't really know which of the three image treatments above make a better layout.</div>
            <div class="text">I had a play about with colours, to add a bit more to the design.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="goldarch.png" alt=""><br><img src="goldbg.png" alt=""><br><img
                    src="goldwhite.png" alt=""><br><img src="goldblank.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'm mostly happy with it now. I think that it's probably best to keep the photos in
                arches, even where it stops the book cover looking like a book. It's a minor issue but I think, on
                balance, I prefer the
                way it looks.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="final.png" alt=""></div>

            <div class="gallery"><img src="wes-info-mockup.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Quite happy with that. Some of the images could do with a bit of work I suppose. </div>
            <div class="title b">Crit</div>
            <div class="text">I printed out the two spreads and stuck them up at the crit</div>

            <div class="text">
                I found the crit really useful; I'd been working on the same two spreads for days and really valued
                having fresh pairs of eyes on my work. The feedback I received can be summarised as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>"I love how you've used the detail of the hotels to form the layout but I think the images
                        could've been used differently. Either all B+W or all colour"</li>
                    <li>[referring to the portrait of Wes] "Choose an image with more colour to match the background (I
                        love the title text)"</li>
                    <li>"Really love this! You could maybe try some other colour palletes and compare?"</li>
                    <li>"Best use of type" x6</li>
                    <li>"Best use of image" x2</li>
                    <li>"Hired"</li>
                    <li>"Like the shape of images and text"</li>
                    <li>"I would flip two columns upside down to create balance"</li>
                    <li>"Archways ✓ ☺"</li>
                    <li>"Best columns"</li>
                </ul>
                Some interesting comments.
            </div>
            <div class="text">I decided to explore the suggestion of changing the photo colours as this was an area I
                myself thought could do with some improvement.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="sepia.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'm not so sure. I want the photos to be part of the article; not merely decoration, but
                something actually useful for reading and understanding what the spreads are trying to say. I don't
                think that's quite achieved by making them all the same colour.</div>
            <div class="text">I don't really agree with the person who suggested turning a couple of my arches upside
                down. Then it'd sort of lose the whole architectural theme that I've tried to get going on.</div>
            <div class="text">I'd sort of chosen my spreads' colour scheme without thinking; I suppose there's no reason
                to keep it in those shades.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="colours.gif" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">None of them jump out at me really. I think the colours themselves work pretty well. They
                didn't translate well to the printed page; I think much of that was me sticking them to a window and
                light shining through.</div>

            <div class="text">I went to the lecture that John did about his design work. I thought it was very
                interesing.</div>
            <div class="text">I admired the spirit of a lot of his work, combining physical processes with digital

            <div class="title a">Picking an idea</div>
            <div class="text">The very first idea I had was for pastry. All different kinds of pastry. It'd be an
                article about the history of pastry maybe? With like a guide to the different varieties. My idea for
                this would be high-res photos of different pastries as backgrounds. I'm drooling at the thought.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="pastry.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">It's something to explore.</div>
            <div class="text">My next idea for an article is about supermarket meal deals. At the risk of sounding like
                a stereotypical Yorkshireman, I like getting good value. You often see a £3 meal deal fridge where one
                of the sandwiches on its own costs £2.75. Add a drink and crisps, and that's a fair discount you're
                getting. I'd write (or, less likely, find) an article that's a sort of tongue-in-cheek investigation of
                the pricing of meal deals, exploring how much food you can get discounted to three quid. Is it a good
                idea? Maybe. Not sure.</div>
            <div class="text">My third idea stretches the definition of 'food' a tad. It's about the sitcom
                dinnerladies, looking at the ways that food is portrayed in comedy. It'd be a serious article, talking
                about the programme's humour and analysing a few quotes to talk about the significance of food to
                people. I really like this idea. I love dinnerladies; it's one of my favourite shows, because it
                combines humour with tragedy, all the time staying warm and grounded. I want the article to have a
                similar tone of voice.</div>
            <div class="text">I wrote up my three ideas into a pitch sheet.</div>
            <iframe
                src="https://padlet-uploads.storage.googleapis.com/1357199379/cc2e36b3fa59c0a210265b62a177acbe/mags.pdf"
                frameborder="0" width="600px" height="800px"></iframe>
            <div class="text">The dinnerladies idea is my favourite. By a long shot. I'll be writing my own article.
                Better get
                started.</div>
            <div class="title b">Spending a week watching telly</div>
            <div class="text">All the episodes of dinnerladies have conveniently been put on the iPlayer in the last
                couple of weeks,
                so I no longer need to rely on a dodgy version on YouTube to do my research.</div>
            <div class="text">I say 'research', what that means in practice is sitting through every episode of the
                programme.</div>
            <div class="text">Whilst watching each episode, I wrote down any quotations or funny lines related to food.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="pg1.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I colour-coded each line according to the character that said it.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="pg2.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">This went on and on.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="pg3.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Twenty pages in fact.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="pg4.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I collected 75 quotations on the subject of food. I broke this down a bit into
                sub-categories, noting them in the margin. I then gave each quote a number, and made a spreadsheet.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="spreadsheet.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'm nothing if not thorough.</div>
            <div class="text">From here I could see which categories are the most fruitful, and which I should write
                about.</div>
            <div class="text">My article is going to consist of a short introduction, and then several mini articles
                exploring a topic about food in detail, each told through a quote from one of the episodes.</div>
            <div class="text">I had said in the pitch that I saw my article fitting into the Radio Times perhaps, or a
                newspaper's Sunday supplement. The tone of voice will be serious, but warm and funny, a bit like
                dinnerladies is.</div>
            <div class="title a">The finished article</div>
            <div class="text">I've finished writing the article. I've got eight mini-articles. Some of them stronger
                than the others. I probably won't make all of them into spreads.</div>
            <iframe src="https://bradleysanso.me/dinnerladies.pdf" frameborder="0" width="600px"
                height="800px"></iframe>
            <div class="text">In the studios I've had three or four staff members say to me it's a good and interesting
                idea for an article, which has allayed my fears somewhat about it not being directly about food in a
                traditional sense.</div>
            <div class="text">The difficult bit was thinking of a title. I settled on using the quote "I take all the
                labels off me tins then I don't know what I'm having for me tea", a line said by Victoria Wood's
                character Bren when the dinnerladies were talking about how they spend their spare time. It's a funny
                line, describing a humourous scenario, but it's fundamentally quite sad also, that that's all the
                pleasure that some people have in life.</div>

                    <div class="text">...and a page number in each bottom corner.</div>

                    <div class="text">At the tops of the pages, there's a header space which is used for a variety of
                        things. Sometimes it's blank, sometimes it's got a section name in, and occasionally pointers to
                        other parts of the magazine.</div>


                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="title b">Starting to make something</div>
            <div class="text">You'll notice in the article above the second part of the quote featured in the headline:
                "It's brilliant. I'm thinking, what's it gonna be? Fruit salad? Alphabetti Spaghetti?".</div>
            <div class="text">So I had an idea. Perhaps not he most original idea in the world, but an idea nonetheless.
                I went to the supermarket and bought a tim of alphabetti spaghetti. Two tins, actually, given I wasn't
                completely confident in the equal distribution of the alphabet throughout the tins.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="trolley.jpg" alt=""><br><span class="caption">(ignore the jelly. that's not
                    from dinnerladies. that's just my pudding.)</span></div>
            <div class="text">I took that back home, put a bin liner on the floor, and laid out all my crockery.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="crockery.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I seperated out the tomato sauce and the pasta, and went through to find the letters to
                spell the words 'alphabetti spaghetti'. </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="alphabet.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'd had the idea to do the same with the other part of that quote, fruit salad. I got a
                tin of mixed fruits, and thought about cutting them up to look like letters.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="f.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I tried slicing a bit of peach to look like a capital F, which I'd then repeat for 'RUIT
                SALAD'. It didn't quite work.</div>
            <div class="text">Instead I just started to arrange the fruit in the shape of letters.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="fs.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I think that's better. But I thought perhaps the letters should be made up of different
                fruits rather than each being one kind.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="fruit-salad/fruitsalad.gif" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Before going to the shop, I went through my notepad of quotes and wrote a shopping list
                with anything mentioned by name on there. This included minestrone, croissants, chickpeas, and
                artificial sweeteners.</div>
            <div class="text">It's obviously impractical to try and replicate my fruit salad idea with a tin of
                minestrone. So my idea for that was to put it in a bowl and add a bread question mark, which will act as
                the punctuation in the quote featuring minestrone.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="big-q.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I thought that was a bit too big, so I took the scissors to another slice of bread and cut
                out some smaller punctuation (now there's a sentence I never thought I'd write).</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="smallq.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I was a bit unsure how to incorporate croissants into text, but decided the best way was
                to collect the crumbs and then arrange them into the shapes of letters.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="crumbs.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="croiss.gif" alt=""><img src="crumbs.gif" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I've spelled out the words 'croissant' and 'crumbs' to fit in a quotation that uses the
                two words. My idea is that the spreads will include a quote on the left hand page, featuring food-based
                typography that I'm making now.</div>
            <div class="text">The final piece of food typography I made used a tea tray and a dispenser full of
                artificial sweeteners.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="sweet.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Time to start sketching out ideas.</div>
            <div class="title a">Making designs</div>
            <div class="text">I started off by getting down one of the articles I definitely knew I wanted to do.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="dinnerladies-sketches/care-1.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Note that in this instance, rather than trying to make any sort of typography out of
                'breakfast in bed', I decided to include photos of the food instead, but play about with the positioning
                to give it a bit of interest. I don't want every page to be too repetitive... "oh, here's the word
                croissant written out in croissant crumbs, oh, here's the word breakfast written in sausages".</div>
            <div class="text">This is the rough sort of layout I want to have over all my information spreads to give it
                a bit of consistency: quote on the left page with interesting typographic effects, 'food is ___'
                subheading on the right hand page, along with a photo of the scene being quoted and the relevant couple
                of paragraphs of my article.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="dinnerladies-sketches/international-1.png" alt=""><img

                    src="dinnerladies-sketches/slimming-1.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I did the rest, too.</div>
            <div class="title b">First spread</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="firstplay.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">This was my first attempt at taking my spread from my brain to the computer. I had a bit
                of a play about with the right hand page, looking to see how I could incorporate the photo in a nice
                way.</div>
            <div class="text">Typographically, I wanted to use the typeface Shrikhand (Google Fonts) for display text,
                as I think it has a nice nostalgic feel right for the sort of tone of voice I'm going for. It's quite
                similar to the font Cooper, but a bit less overused.</div>
            <div class="text">I realised at this point that the screenshots I would take wouldn't exactly be in high-def
                quality, such is the pitfalls of using a twenty year-old programme as source material. However, I think
                that readers would accept that. I tried uploading the screengrab to some online tool that promised to
                use AI to apparently upscale the image, it wasn't fruitful.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="careee.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I made a version with a bigger photo and the text arranged differently, but I don't think
                it looked very good.</div>
            <div class="text">I then did what I consider to be a more elegant treatment of the text, wrapping it around
                the image.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="cropped.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">The right hand side looks awfully bare. And whilst I understand, whitespace is important
                and all that; I'm designing for a mass market publication here, I think a totally blank space would
                look far more at home in COS magazine for example than in the Radio Times.</div>
            <div class="text">So I went back to the notepad with an idea. It was one that I'd had for a while, wanting
                to incorporate the dinnerladies' apron fabric pattern into the design. </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="foodis.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I think this has the potential to bring some proper visual continuity to my spreads,
                uniting them as part of one article.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="elegant.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I'm not totally sure this works.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="imgtrace.gif" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Image Trace has sorted that out. I couldn't quite decide which of the results to use,
                whether to keep it just to a handful of colours or to make it more photorealistic. In the end I went
                with 8 colours.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="have.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I like this. I think having the apron motif running through every page will be nice. My
                one concern is that the pattern and the photos of the staff in aprons might clash a bit. But they're at
                different scales so it shouldn't matter too much.</div>
            <div class="text">My attention then turned to starting to assemble the quote page of this spread.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="startquote.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I wanted to put a picture of a cooked breakfast in the middle, which I eventually found
                one of. I arranged it to fit and this is what I came up with:</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="brekkie.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">At this point I spoke to a member of staff who said she'd seen the spread over my shoulder
                and thought it looked interesting. However she did say that she didn't read the page in the anticipated
                order. Her eyes were first drawn to 'Mum!' and then to 'Care...'. Not ideal. I need to have a play about
                with hierarchy to try and reduce the prominence of parts of the quotes, whilst keeping a bit of
                distinction between speakers within quotes.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="better.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I think this is better. The issue now is that the picture I've used isn't exactly the sort
                I'd imagine the characters in dinnerladies making. Unfortunately, the stock photos that exist have a
                tendency to be more like a posh restaurant's food than a canteen's. I looked on Wikimedia Commons,
                figuring somebody must've gone to a greasy spoon and uploaded something.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="unappealing.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">That's a bit more like it I suppose, but it looks rather unappetising. Perhaps it's the
                blue plate.</div>
            <div class="text">So I looked back at that initial sketch, and decided to use seperate elements for the
                items of food in the cooked breakfast. I sourced assets from stock image sites all over the place,
                trying to assemble something resembling a cooked breakfast.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="lookedback.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">That's better. That's my final design for this spread.</div>
            <div class="title b">Second spread</div>
            <div class="text">I decided to try and make a second spread, using the first as a sort of template. I chose
                to do the Food is political mini-article, with the quote mentioning the class connotations of wholemeal
                pitta breads.</div>
            <div class="text">Oddly enough, at this time I was sat in the studio next to Noura, who had just got out a
                wholemeal pitta. I was very kindly allowed to photograph it to use in this article. Thank you for saving
                me a trip to Asda.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="pitta.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I edited it a bit to make it look like it'd been folded.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="filded.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I then arranged them into a staggered pattern and added text.</div>

            <div class="text">I'm not so happy with the text wrapping on this one. Feels a bit too tight and unwieldy.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="bolded.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I've emboldened the first line of the quote, which I think makes it a lot better.</div>
            <div class="title a">Third spread</div>
            <div class="text">For the next spread I'm doing the International one, with the croissant crumbs.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="inter.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">It's not quite working for me, this one. Perhaps it's the colouring. I'd tried, on all my
                spreads, to use only colours picked from the apron pattern on the right hand page. But for this spread I
                deviated a bit, taking the colour of a croissant crumb and using that as the colour for the quote text.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="national.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Changing the colours round a bit makes it slightly better. But I don't really think the
                drab grey is very nice as a background.</div>
            <div class="text">So I decided to go back to beige, but with bolder orange text this time. It's not
                explicitly croissant-coloured, but I suppose the croissant colour is like a midpoint between the text
                and background tones.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="beige.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="title b">Fourth spread</div>
            <div class="text">My fourth spread is the Educational one, with the minestrone, making the point about the
                futility of life in the factory. I wanted to incorporate the pictures I'd taken of the soup.</div>
            <div class="text">I started by assembling the words of the quote on the paper. Then I added the soup bowl.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="educ.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">There's something missing. I was a bit hesitant to use the
                minestrone-with-a-bread-question-mark image, I thought it was a bit corny maybe. But it just looks bare
                as it is.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="minestrone.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">There's no real focal point to this. So I stuck the big bowl back in, and changed the
                background colour to make it more minestrone-y.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="educa.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">That's better. Still not 100% happy with it. I'm not sure about the red text on orange of
                the final line of the quote, and I'm also not convinced by the multiple sizes of soup bowls.</div>
            <div class="title a">Fifth spread</div>
            <div class="text">The last mini-article I'm going to make a spread for is the one about dieting, as I wrote
                it as a sort of conclusion for the article.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="screensh.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I took away the tea tray background from the sweeteners and then added the letters, making
                the quote around it. I think it looks quite sparse, but then again that's probably just my tendency to
                want to fill every space with something.</div>
            <div class="text">The screenshots are poor, I'll admit. It's a composite of two different shots within a
                scene, but Bren's in the back of her shot and Dolly's at the front of hers. So in trying to make them
                the same size I've enlarged Victoria Wood and she's gone rather pixellated unfortunately.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="milk.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I've cropped Dolly's right arm off to give it consistency with all the other pages, and
                I've taken a photo of the cannister that the sweeteners come in to add *something* to the quote page.
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="golden.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Finally I've made the cannister gold rather than green, to make it fit in more with
                the sheet.</div>
            <div class="title b">Impact spread</div>
            <div class="text">My initial idea for the impact spread was to use tin cans.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="dinnerladies-sketches/impact-tins-1.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Sue suggested I split the quote in the title up into two, which I think is a good idea.
            </div>
            <div class="text">I started to do the layouts on InDesign; I find making iterations digitally far easier
                than sketching, it helps me get my ideas down quicker, helped by the presence of a 'duplicate' button as
                well as 'undo'.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact1.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">This was my first version. The tins were photographed by me, and previously held fruit
                cocktall, alphabetti spaghetti, and minestrone. I found it quite difficult to take a good photo to be
                honest. I either got my reflection in, or couldn't get the angles right.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact2.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">So I tried doing away with the tins altogether, and sticking a portrait of Victoria Wood
                on there. I considered adding a photo of the whole cast, but the article is more of a tribute to Vic's
                writing about food than to the performances, great though they are. So it felt right to just have a
                picture of her on there, in her apron.</div>
            <div class="text">I'm not sure about that image though. Her pose is a bit odd.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact3.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">That's a nicer picture. But I don't think the spread is very balanced, and I don't like
                the text being up at the top.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact4.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I had another go at doing one with the tins. All on one page this time, with the quote on
                the other page. This echos the layout of the information spreads.</div>
            <div class="text">I still wasn't feeling it though. Perhaps changing the colour would make a difference, I
                thought.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact5.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I accepted that my tin can photos aren't very good, and used a stock image instead.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact6.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I thought it looked a bit boring really, so I experimented with putting the picture of
                Victoria back in.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact7.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Then I got carried away.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact8.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I tried replacing the middle tins with the apron pattern for a bit of continuity with the
                other spreads.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact9.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I then copied the column of apron pattern from the information spreads into this one. I
                quite like this one:
            </div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact10.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Then I decided again to ditch the tins and just let the pattern do the talking.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact11.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I considered, for a few seconds, putting the text on tin cans.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact12.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">But quickly abandoned that idea.</div>
            <div class="text">I went back to putting a picture of Victoria Wood on there.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact13.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">The apron + apron pattern might be a bit much.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact14.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I've added an outline to the portrait which makes it a bit more seperate.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="impact15.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">Finally, I've put the colours back to the brown and red combo. It feels warmer and more
                fitting to me.</div>
            <div class="title b">BONUS EXTRA SPREAD!</div>
            <div class="text">Well, it seemed a wrong to have collected all those quotes just for them to go to waste.
            </div>
            <div class="text">So I collected a few of the best and put an extra spread together of them.</div>
            <div class="gallery"><img src="bonus.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">I know it's far from perfect. It was put together in twendy minutes.</div>
            <div class="text">I felt that maybe the text colours could alternate a bit to help with telling the quotes
                apart a bit.</div>

                    <div class="text">
                        When making my quotes spread, I realised that I was sort of being unconsciously influenced by
                        this piece of artwork, which I've seen many a time on trips to Blackpool. Situated on the prom
                        at the base of the Tower, it consists of jokes, one-liners, and catchphrases from British
                        comedy, written on floor tiles. It is 2200 square metres in size, and contains 160,000 letters.
                        It was installed in 2011 as part of the regeneration of Blackpool's seafront.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        My family and I go to Blackpool every year. I really like the place; it's down-to-earth, not
                        pretentious, but still manages to retain the magic that I loved it for as a child. These sorts
                        of feelings - of warmth and homeliness - are echoed in the choice of comedy catchphrases on the
                        artwork. Blackpool's perhaps better known for ballroom dancing than standup comedy, but it is
                        comedy that, to me, has a greater appeal and is most similar to how I perceive the town: homely,
                        warm, and nostalgic.
                    </div>
                    <div class="text">
                        I really like the artwork. This quotes page that I've made is (in a way) a sort of allusion to
                        it - both with similar aims, of raising a laugh through quoting funny and relatable humour. I
                        really like the typography that Young chose; a range of fonts, all in red, black, and blue. It's
                        of its time I suppose, I seem to remember a lot of organisations adopted nostalgic branding
                        around that time (for example the resurgence of Keep Calm and Carry On, and the patriotic summer
                        of 2012 with the Jubilee and the Olympics). But I really like it, I think it's really good at
                        what it sets out to do.

            <div class="gallery"><img src="din-crit.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="text">The feedback I got was as follows:
                <ul>

                    <li>"Best use of type" x2</li>

                    <li>"Really love the theme of these spreads, reminds me of childhood. Maybe just change the quotes

                Some really helpful feedback there. I expected that the quotes spread would be the one that people
                weren't so keen on, I'll admit it is quite difficult to read and not especially nice to look at either.
                This probably wasn't helped by me sticking the pages up on the window, with the light shining through, a
                lot of the text was illegible. If I had more time I'd make a few new versions with the feedback taken on
                board, but unfortunately there isn't much time before submitting.

        <div class="subtitle">Evaluation</div>
        <div class="sections">
            <div class="text">I've really enjoyed this project. I wasn't sure I would so much to be honest. I didn't
                really consider myself to be that much of a magazine fan before. I used to get a computer magazine every
                fortnight. And I occasionally pick up Private Eye. But other than that I'm not exactly embedded in the
                whole culture around publishing or anything like that. </div>
            <div class="text">Of the two projects, I enjoyed both, but preferred the second one especially. I liked
                having the freedom to take the project my own way. However, that's not to say I didn't like the Wes
                Anderson project; I went from not really knowing who he was to being something of a fan within about a
                fortnight. And the food project; I made something perhaps unexpected and unconventional, but I think it
                captures the brief well by exploring what food can mean to people. </div>
            <div class="text">The research for this project essentially involved immersing myself in the two worlds of
                Wes Anderson and Victoria Wood quite quickly. For the first project, I think going to see The French
                Dispatch was really useful. I wasn't sure whether to go, if I'd find it a bit boring or whatever. But
                I'm glad I went because it was the scenes in that film that inspired the direction I took my designs in.
                For the food project, I spent hours watching every episode of dinnerladies and noting down jokes and
                quotes about food, which was useful. But I suppose my trip around the supermarket was research in a way;
                in the search for items mentioned in the show, I discovered a lot more about food - products that I
                didn't know existed, and new stories behind items we see every day.
            </div>
            <div class="text">I think that my idea generation hasn't been especially good in these projects; generally,
                I had an idea really early on and wanted to go with that (and usually did go with that). For example in
                the Wes Anderson project, a lot of my sketches were united around one theme, and the ones that weren't I
                quickly discarded. I definitely need to improve here.</div>
            <div class="text">I worry that in the food project I might have fallen into the old trap of quantity over
                quality again. I presented five very similar spreads at the crit; I wrote my own article (with far more
                words than was called for), and wanted to design spreads for everything, no matter how many times the
                tutors tried to suggest that I "just focus on one or two for the time being". I can't help myself!</div>
            <div class="text">I'd say I'm reasonably happy with my designs for the spreads. I'm not quite sure they're
                as polished as would be expected of professional work (especially the Wes Anderson project).</div>
        </div>
        <div class="text">If I was doing the project again, would I do it the same? I don't think so, no. I'd probably
            have spent more time in the Wes Anderson project watching a few more of his films, so that I had more
            references than just The French Dispatch. I might have been able to come up with more ideas that way. And
            would I have chosen to do the dinnerladies article rather than something more directly food-based? I'm not
            so sure.</div>
        <div class="text">I'm glad the project's over - not because it's especially stressful or boring or anything -
            but just because I want to move on to something else. With a break first of course.</div>
