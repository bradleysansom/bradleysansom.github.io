        <p data-splitting style="display:inline;">My message is that we’ll be watching you.<br><br>This is all wrong. I
            shouldn’t be up here. I
            should be back
            in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to
            us young people for hope. How dare you!<br><br>You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with
            your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones.
            People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems
            are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction,
            and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of
            eternal economic growth. How dare you!<br><br>For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal
            clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here
            saying that you’re doing enough, when the politics and
            solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.<br><br>You say you hear us and that you understand the
            urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not
            want to believe that. Because if you really understood the
            situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be
            evil. And that I refuse to believe.<br><br>You are failing us. But the young people are starting to
            understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations
            are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say:</p>
        <p style="display:inline;font-weight:700"> We will
            never forgive you.</p>
