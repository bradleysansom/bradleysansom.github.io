        <p>My message is that we’ll be watching you.</p>
        <p>This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back
            in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to
            us young people for hope. How dare you!</p>
        <p>You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with
            your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones.
            People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems
            are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction,
            and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of
            eternal economic growth. How dare you!</p>
        <p>For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal
            clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here
            saying that you’re doing enough, when the politics and
            solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.</p>
        <p>You say you hear us and that you understand the
            urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not
            want to believe that. Because if you really understood the
            situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be
            evil. And that I refuse to believe.</p>
        <p>The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in
            10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5
            degrees [Celsius], and the risk of setting off irreversible
            chain reactions beyond human control.</p>
        <p>Fifty percent may be acceptable to you. But those
            numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback
            loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or
            the aspects of equity and climate justice. They also rely on
            my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your
            CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.</p>
        <p>So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us – we who
            have to live with the consequences. To have a 67% chance
            of staying below a 1.5 degrees global temperature rise –
            the best odds given by the [Intergovernmental Panel on
            Climate Change] – the world had 420 gigatons of CO2
            left to emit back on January 1st, 2018. Today that figure is
            already down to less than 350 gigatons.</p>
        <p>How dare you pretend that this can be solved with
            just ‘business as usual’ and some technical solutions ? With
            today’s emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be
            entirely gone within less than 8½ years.</p>
        <p>There will not be any solutions or plans presented in
            line with these figures here today, because these numbers
            are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature
            enough to tell it like it is.</p>
        <p>You are failing us. But the young people are starting to
            understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations
            are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say : We will
            never forgive you.</p>
        <p>We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right
            now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And
            change is coming, whether you like it or not. Thank you.</p>
