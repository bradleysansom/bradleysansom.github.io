                    <p>Collaborating with four students from across the Graphic Design and Fashion Art Direction courses, we directed a
        fashion
        shoot inspired by the work of <a href="https://www.bruceasbestos.info" class="iconLink">Bruce Asbestos</a> and then curated an interactive digital lookbook.</p>

    <h3 class="sectionHeader">Our monsters</h3>
    <p>At the centre of our concept was the idea of 'monsters' - personal and societal demons that we wanted to tackle
        through our designs. I chose to confront consumerism, therefore I was focussed on upcycling various materials
        into a new piece of art.</p>

    <p>I transformed dozens of shopping receipts into an outfit, incorporating the hallmark dayglo colours of Bruce
        Asbestos.</p>

    <h3 class="sectionHeader">Fashion shoot</h3>
    <p>As a team, we got together our various creations along with other items of clothing, directing a fashion shoot.

    <h3 class="sectionHeader">Creating a digital lookbook</h3>
    <p>The area of the project which I led on was the creation of a web-based digital lookbook.</p>

    <p>The site was built using <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/" class="iconLink">Greensock</a> for animation, and makes use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap" class="iconLink"><code>scroll-snap</code></a> to give the site more of a paged feel.</p>
