                    A quick game I made in a couple of hours. Based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_a_Minute" style="color:black;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:underline;">BBC Radio 4 panel show of the same name</a>, where players have to speak for sixty seconds on a subject without hesitation, repetition, or deviation, this web app allows you to play along at home, with between two and four players.
