I've spent the last few months designing for aAh!, Manchester's student-led arts and culture magazine. In March 2023, the newest issue was published, and I designed a few of the spreads within, in collaboration with photographers, illustrators, and other designers. In the run-up to the launch, I helped out with the social media promotion of the issue, creating graphics and animations to create a buzz around the issue. Additionally, I've developed a web app which allows for the creation of consistent social media graphics for the promotion of stories across the magazine.
