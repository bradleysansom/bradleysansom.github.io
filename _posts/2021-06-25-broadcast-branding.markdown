blurb: Producing a comprehensive branding system for a fictional local TV channel, inspired by technical test cards and patterns. I extended the brief to include coded elements incorporating randomisation and graphic generation to blend the worlds of graphics and computing. Later parts of the project focussed on designing branding for local elections news coverage, including set design and 3D rendering.
