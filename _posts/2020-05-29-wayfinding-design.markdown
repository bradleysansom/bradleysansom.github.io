blurb: Producing a set of wayfinding signs for various locations in Bradford city centre with the aim of making it a nicer place for pedestrians. The arrival of the lockdown meant that the project had to be completed using found imagery without being able to visit the sites in person, allowing me to explore 360° panoramic images. I also designed a family of icons representing major public buildings in Bradford which I incorporated on to the signage.
